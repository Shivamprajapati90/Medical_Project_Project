 Medical Record Dashboard (ASP.NET Core MVC + API + MSSQL)

A complete Medical Record Management System built using ASP.NET Core MVC for the frontend, ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend, and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) for the database.
Users can register, log in, manage profiles, and upload/view medical files securely — all handled via APIs.

This project demonstrates a clean, full-stack .NET application architecture with:

Session-based user authentication

Profile management

Medical file upload & preview

Secure backend API integration

MSSQL database with stored procedures
